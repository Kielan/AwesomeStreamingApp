This is  a programming challenge/hackathon style react native app using the youtube v3 api for livestreaming and chat inside of a mobile application. Currently Finished with the original sprint/spec at about ~20 hours into the project, I will keep some benchmarkers for features as I continue to build out this demo.

To run app

npm install

react-native run-ios (android coming soon - soon!)

###Awesome Streaming App Specifications
- [x] see the top concurrent viewer Youtube Stream
- [x] see live chat of the top viewed youtube video
- [x] Routing navigation
- [x] Google signin iOS functionality
- [ ] Google signin android functionality
- [ ] Flex box wireframe layout
- [ ] Aesthetic fundamental layout (salmon squash theme)
- [x] Gather Streams from youtube api and find viewcount in schema
- [x] Query chat for top video
- [x] enable user to participate in chat
- [ ] create another interface that will return all chat messages from a given username (i.e. filter for messages by name on a separate view).
My only question is regarding the last spec, is creating another interface like a chat box for sending messages or a tabbed filter for users, I am assuming just an input box.
## Bonus/Second Sprint
- [ ] calculate messages/second
- [x] line chart
- [ ] donut chart
- [ ]
